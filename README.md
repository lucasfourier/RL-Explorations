# RL-Explorations
This repository contains implementations, notes, and experiments related to Reinforcement Learning (RL). It includes both foundational concepts and various toy projects exploring RL applications across different domains.

Of course, the first implementation is just a quick naive one of the multi-armed bandit problem based on Sutton's book, which contains action-value methods and the $\epsilon$-greedy strategy.
